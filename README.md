## Contract
```0x44dEa70BE365F616F1b47346005045374e827b83```

Nightmare On Fantom St. is a trick-or-treat themed dice game. Our contract uses the on-chain randomness strategy from $LOOT. Every mint is one attempt at minting a legendary. You will roll a four-sided die when you mint to determine the “Mint-Type” (Trick or Treat). Then, you roll an eight-sided die to determine if your mint goes from “Common” to “Rare.” Only if you win the twelve-sided die roll will you roll an eight-sided die to decide whether you mint a “Legendary.” The end goal of the game is to mint a legendary before time runs out.

## Minting
Pricing for this project is designed so that anyone can participate. Each mint will be 1 FTM. To increase your odds of minting a legendary and winning a free spooky pixel Profile Picture (PFP), you are allowed to mint multiples in 1 transaction. The gas fees on Fantom give us the flexibility to build affordable gamified contracts.<br>
1 MINT = 1 FTM<br>
Minting in Multiples is allowed. The Smart Contract does not limit how many mints you can perform in 1 transaction; however, the network does. We found that the sweet spot was 200 mints and lower.

## Supply
This project does not have a traditional max supply. You will ONLY be able to mint this project during Halloween Weekend.
The open minting period is referred to as "The Haunting". After that, the contract will permanently stop minting (Exorcism).
